# Wistia Player React

This app contains a React component for the Wistia player: `<WistiaEmbed>`.

Check out `/components/wistia_embed.js` to see the internals of the component, and take a look at how the component gets _used_ over in `/App.js`.

This app lives on Glitch, so you can make a working copy of it and start breaking/fixing stuff (the best way to learn!) right now. Just click **Remix**.
